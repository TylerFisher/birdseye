### What is this

### The idea

**How might we allow readers to curate their own picture stories?**  
Using the concept of a photoroll, our prototype will allow a user to view a large set of photos and filter based on tags like color, emotion, location, and more.

Editors can indicate featured images that will be called out in the interface more prominently than the smaller series of pictures. The user can click or press to expand any of the images.

Our hope is that showing a large set of photos will provide important context and location awareness, and allow users to immerse themselves into an event.
